## Please read before contributing

1. Do not post questions in the issues tracker. If you have any questions about Ecto, use the [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elixir-ecto) or Stack Overflow.

2. Do a small search on the tracker before submitting opening an issue to see if it was already suggested, reported or fixed.

3. When reporting an issue, please include as much information as possible: which Elixir and Ecto versions as well as the database, adapter and their respective versions. If there is an error, include the code, error message and stacktrace. Issues that do not provide proper information will be closed.

4. Feature requests must also be first discussed in mailing list. Even if you would like to contribute the feature yourself, it is better to ask before doing the work in case the feature is not desired by the Ecto team. Once a consensus is reached, the feature request can be moved to the tracker.

5. All interactions in the project follow the same [Code of Conduct as Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

That's it! The more information you give, the easier it is for us to track bugs, evaluate features and answer to reports. Remember to be polite and that we are here to help.

Thank you!
